## CarbonGuard

The Dashboard is a robust web application designed to empower car assemblers in effectively managing their operations and reducing carbon emissions.
This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface with key features tailored to meet the needs of car assemblers.

### User Registration and Profile Management

This feature allows car assemblers to create accounts securely by providing essential information such as their name, email, phone number, and password. Once registered, users can log in and out of their dashboard accounts.

### Emission Data

This feature enables the car assemblers to collect and process real-time data related to vehicle emissions. It captures crucial data points, such as the type of fuel used, distance traveled, and vehicle speed. The system efficiently stores this information and makes it available for real-time processing and analysis.

### Carbon Credits Calculation

The Carbon Credits Calculation feature computes carbon credits based on the emissions data collected from the vehicles. These calculations adhere to the government-defined conversion formula for carbon credits. This feature ensures accurate calculations and helps the car assemblers understand its environmental impact better.

### Vehicle Information

Car assemblers can access detailed information about their registered vehicles within the fleet. This includes essential data such as number plates and enngine type.
